# self--designed-game
tic-tac-toe
The luggage game
there's rope tied up to the luggage
for the first time we will get them some text directions
and they will click on 'next'to continue with the game
it has to fall perfectly on the luggage down below on the ground
if it does then we will play a short tune to encourage the player
if the person fails to do so then we can write beter luck next time
but then if the luggage falls on the ground then the user would lose the game
